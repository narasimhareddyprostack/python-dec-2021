What is Python?
python - general purpose High Level Programing Language.
Developed By - Van Rossum - 1990.

First programming language for beginners.

OOP Language  - Java, C++[Python]  
Script Programing Language - Javascript, VB, perl,[Python]

Identifier Rules:
---------------------
1.a to Z / A to Z (Alphabet symbols)
2.Identifier should not start with digits 
3.Underscore(_) , If identifier start with (_) -it indicate private 
4.Identifier are case sensitive 
5.We cant use reserved/keywords as identifiers.
6.Special symbols are not allowed

What is Keywords?

Python is simple and easy to Learn?


['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 
'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 
'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 
'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 
'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 
'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 
'while', 'with', 'yield']

Python is Dynamically Typed Programing Language.
we are not required to specify the data type explictilty.

based on the provided value, type will be assigned.

Data Types in Pyton 
-------------------
int 
bool
float 
str 

bytes
bytearray
range

list
tuple
dict
set

frozenset
None 


Python fundamental data types.
------------------------------
int 
float 
bool
str 

In Python contains several built-in functions 
print()
type() - to check the type of variable.
id() - address of object - JVM print inter



int Data Type:
a = 101

we can represent int values in the following ways 

1.decimal form
2.binary form 
3.octal form   (0 to 7)
4.HexaDecimal Form (0 to 9 + A to F)


1.Decimal Form(base-10)
----------------------------
base-10 means (0 to 9 ) 
Its default number system.
Allowed digits are 0 to 9 

2.Binary



Base conversion built-in functions.
bin()
hex()
oct()

float Data Types
------------------

Type Casting
-------------

int()
float()
str()
bool()
complex()

===============================
Python built-in funciton 
-------------------------
print()
id() 
type()

Type casting built-in functions 
---------------------------------
int()
bool()
complex()
str()
float()

bin() 
hex()
oct()

============================================
Python Data Types (13+) 

int : 
float 
bool
str 

complex - scientific application and Electrical Engineering

bytes  
bytes represents group of  byte numbers just like array


size = [38,40,42,44] // In JS we called array 
b = bytes(x)


bytearray 
#what is bytearray?
bytearray is extactly same as bytes except that its elemetns we can modify

bytes  and bytearray?

bytes are immutable 
bytearray is mutable.

range 

list  - mutable 
tuple - immutable
set 
dict 

frozenset 
None 

================================
list Data types:
If we want to represent a group of values a single entity where insertion order required.

1.duplicate are allowed 
2.heterogeneous elemetns are allowed 
3.incr/decr - growable nature 
4.inserion order is preserved
5.[] 
6.Mutable object

Tuple data Types
==================
exactly same as list data type except - tuple is immutable.
we cant change the values.


set :
=================
If we want to present a group of values a single entity 
with out duplicate and where order is not imp, then we go for set.

1.insertion order is not preserved
2.duplicate are not allowed
3.heterogeneous objects are allowed 
4.growable in nature 
5.index concept is not applicable
6.Set is mutable object.

set vs frozenset
set - is mutable
frozenset - is immutable 


None?
====================================
Type             
int            - immutable 
float          - immutable 
complex        - immutable
bool           - immutable 
str            - immutable 
bytes          - immutable
bytearray      - mutable 
 
range          - immutable 
list []        - mutable( growable in nature)
set   {}       - mutable
tuple ()      - immutable
dict  {}      - mutable
frozenset     - immutable
None          - immutable



a = 100
a = 200 

Pyton Operators:
====================

Ternary Operator 

Special Operator

Identity Operatos 
is 
is not
Membership Operator
in     - Return True if the given object present in the specified collection.
not in - Return True if the given object not present in the specified collection.



Input and print Statement

Reading dynamic input from keyboard:

a = input("Plese Enter Value:")



=====================================
if-elif-else (if else ladder)





break 
we can use break statement/keyword inside loops(for and while)
to break loop based on condition.

for i in range(1,10):
print(i)



continue:
we can use continue statement/keyword to skip the current iteration and continue next iteration.



pass - statement :
we can define empty block with pass keyboard.

pass 
a)It is empty block
b)null state 
c)won't do anything


for value in sequence: 
   pass 
   
  
i=0
while i<=10:
   pass
   i =i +1 

we can use loops  to repeat code execution.
For loop : iterate every item in the sequence 

while loop: until condition false , iterate group of statement .

How to exit from the loop?
by using break statement 

how to skip the current iteration?
using continue statement. 
======================================

List Data Type 

create Read 

How to Read List , list elements 
Iterating list using while and for loop .

List built-in function 
len() - funciton
size = ['s','m','l']
print(len(size))
len()  - return the number of elemens in the list.

count() -return the number of occurances of item in the list 
index() -return the index of first occurance of specified item

size = ['s','m','l','m','m']
print(size.index('m'))


Note:If the specified element not present in the list then we will get ValueError: 'x' is not in list

Better before using index() method we have to check whether item present in the list of not.

with help of membership operator in
print('s' in size)

size = ['s','m','l','m','m']
print(size.index('x'))
print('s' in size)


count() - -return the number of occurances of item in the list 


updating list 
=============
append() - to add element at the end of the list 
insert() - insert the element @ specifed index position.
extend() 

deleting list element 
remove()
pop()



extend() - To add all items of one list to anoter list 

list1  = [1,2,3,4]
list2 =[5,6,7,8]
list1.extend(list2) #list 2 will be added to list1
print(list1)
print(list2)


append() and insert() - adding the element
extend() - add list to another list 

remove() function:
we can use this function, to remove the specifed item form list.

If the item present multiple times , only first occurance will be removed.


reverse() - reverse() function - used to reverse ordering the list .

 
sort() - sort the elements.


number -  Ascending order  
string -  Alphabetical order 

Note: To use sort() function, compusary list should contain only homogenous elemtns 
other wise will get Error,
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
